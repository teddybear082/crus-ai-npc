"Mark, the chief of the Cult of Order PD has long been useful in enforcing our will on the general populace but has recently started to get sloppy and uncontrollable. His messages, when he actually manages to respond, are completely incoherent and increasingly violent. We believe this rapid change in character has been caused by the experimental steroids supplied to him by the leader of the narcotics unit, Magnus. Kill both of them and the Cult of Order can begin its healing process."

Most of the cops wield New Safety M62s. Some instead carry Balotelli Hypernovas.

The Flashlight can be found carried by a Darkworlder on a rooftop. Turn right, and then take the alley on the right. go into the building and jump out the window on the far left to cross the rooftop.

A Riot Pacifier can be found on the first floor, through several green doors. It is surrounded by a fake floor, so grab it without entering the room.

Implants[]
The Cortical Scaledown+ can be found on the third floor. Make sure you're cursed, then go to the room with the police chief, and go past into the star room and the spiraling hallway. Go to the center of the spiral and climb the ladder, then go through the cursed door. The item is on the table next to the second bouncy castle enemy.
