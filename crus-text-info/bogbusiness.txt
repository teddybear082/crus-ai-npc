"We have finally discovered the base of the Eternal Swamp Cult. They've been launching assaults against our fracking operations for months now fucking up our profits. If you go in there and kill their leader WILD PIG they'll be sure to devolve into endless infighting and bickering. Remember, don't eat any berries you can't identify."

Many enemies in this area wield a Riot Pacifier, New Safety M62, or Mowzer SP99.

A guard in a semi-hidden area wields a Stern AWS 3000.

A guard inside the mountain wields a BN-99.

Implants[]
The Hazmat Suit can be found here. Take the path to the right around the central mountain, past the first island with a tree and one guard, then past the larger island with a huge tree and two guards. There's a small island past them. Turn right, and go toward a crevice between the walls. The item is on a table, past four hounds, a flower beast, and a guard wielding a Stern AWS 3000.

Secret mission[]
To find the entrance to Miner's Miracle, take the path to the right from the spawn, past the island with a tree and one guard, then to the larger island with a huge tree and two guards. To your left there should be a stone tunnel into the mountain. Almost all the way through the tunnel is a door on the left. Inside you will find a small maze, with as little as two guards inside. Just stay on your toes and hug the left wall, you'll find it easily.
