"Governor Bill Gurney is going to be hosting a campaign rally in the Cancer City Megamall. He has made a name for himself taking a strong stand against multinational corporations and monopolies. It should be obvious even to a meathead like you that this isn't very good for us. Thankfully our interests align with those of the shadow president and we've been given free hands to do with Bill as we wish. Expect heavy security and keep in mind that the Megamall is ancient and has many forgotten passages."
