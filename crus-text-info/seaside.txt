"Hey sorry about the last one... Someone fat fingered the social security number of the target and it ended up being you by accident. Just what are the chances? Well, anyway. A group of seasteaders have recently acquired vast fortunes through biocurrency speculation. It wasn't however enough to attain their dream of building an artificial floating island on the open seas, so they've had to settle for a compromise and have purchased their own cruise ship, the 'Titanium Princess'. It is now a den of pathetic losers living out their depraved fantasies. We wouldn't usually care about this sort of thing but a certain governmental agency has offered us a deal that would secure the funding of the risk management department for years to come. They want these guys to be made an example of what happens when you play sovereign so go full hog I guess haha."

A Mowzer SP99 can be found on the third floor, on the port (left) side of the ship. From the spawn, go into the main section of the ship and pass the VIRTUE kiosk. Next to a snack machine is a door, enter and go up two flights of stairs. The gun is behind the second door on the left down the hallway, guarded by one dude.
