"We recently gave the goofood and biocomputing startup G-TECH a significant seed capital of around five billion dollars. We have also been helping them by supplying proprietary research data which it turns out they have been selling to our competitors for large sums of money. On top of this they have not produced any results and have wasted most of their funding on purchasing chunkopops and expensive properties at an elite gated community built on an ancient mass grave, which will soon hopefully have an addition of three fresh new bodies. Good luck."

Cursed Torch[]
Can be found underneath the closest house when you spawn. Be sure to bring a flashlight, and go into the basement with the flower beast, then through the holy door. Traveling through the darkened catacombs, take the first left, then go straight and follow the hall left into a room with two zombies. One may be inside a wall, either way you must walk through an illusory wall (on your right when you enter). Look down into the hole to make sure you fall on the wooden planks, and use them to reach the doorway at the bottom, avoiding the toxic water. The item will be on a strange altar just ahead.

Icaros Machine[]
Can be found in the wooden house on top of the rotating tower and spiked building. From the spawn point take the right fork in the road and go straight ahead, it'll be the first house on your right. The house can be reached using rocket jumps or the Grappendix. The item is simply laying on a table.

Secret Missions[]
The entrance to Darkworld can be found here, at the bottom of the catacombs. Enter under the first house on the left, go into the basement and through the holy door past the flower beast. Go down the hallway and take two left turns, then head down the large hole in the floor. You should fall into a room with two zombies, leave through the only exit. There should be a tunnel of skulls leading down and in, until you reach a bridge in the darkness, and an underground castle. The painting is inside the castle.
