"It has come to our attention that the CEO of Advanced Orbital Instruments has been doing too good of a job trying to increase the survival rate of our mission to Mercury, currently estimated at around 20%. This simply won't do as it is first and foremost a sacrificial mission designed to satiate the appetites of some of our higher ups. Once you get rid of him we'll be free to install our own CEO who is more attuned to the concept of mass scale human sacrifice."

Description[]
Sin Space Engineering is the third level of Cruelty Squad. The level contains the Fiberglass fishing rod, an extremely useful money making tool, the Minato M9 , and a Forklift to the left of spawn; which despite the name, cannot lift forks. Because the target of this level is so high up and visible from spawn, and the exit is right next to you, you can beat the level extremely quickly if you shoot at the target with the Security Systems Anti-Armour Device, Riot Pacifier, or any other weapon paired with the Angular Advantage Tactical Munitions implant from spawn.

A Balotelli Hypernova can be found in a building behind the pyramid, next to a silenced pistol and R5

The target wields a Minato M9, and one can be found inside a shipping container, guarded by a Mutant.

The Fiberglass Fishing Rod can be found in a shack on an island in the middle of the lake, directly backwards from the spawn location.
