"The Corporate Arch Demoness Elsa Holmes recently spent an evening at the esteemed Fatberg Casino and somehow managed to lose the entirety of her vacation bonus. She's been seething mad ever since then and wants revenge. If this was anyone else we'd just laugh it off but since it's her we'll have to do something about it, that is go and murder the owner of the casino in his office. You should try some of the slotmachines while you're there, they're absolutely breathtaking."

Mission[]
"Murder the owner of Fatberg Casino"

Description[]
Casino[]
The map of this mission takes place in a casino, and thus comes with all of the trappings of a casino- if, however, warped by the self-absorbed world of the game. There are no games which involve multiple players, such as cards or roulette, but rather a strict adherence to slot machines which The Handler finds "absolutely breathtaking."

The following slot machines can be found on the game floor:

Jack Off Jack Pot
Meat slot machine
Gun slot machine
